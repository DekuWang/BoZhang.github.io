There once was an luring urban myth saying that if one can win the game would gain countless money as prize, and his/her destiny would instantly change to become the mightiest overnight. All the participants need only one stake——their souls. In the strange and lifeless scene, four gamblers are trying to run away from the devil, but there is no exit. All they can do is to perform a mystery sealing ritual to expel the devil and redeem their souls. A Tempting Gamble No one knows that this soul-gambling game is nothing but a hoax made by a ghost called Xi’E (from In Search of the Supernatural, Jin Dynasty). Ghost Xi’E is evil in its nature yet not powerful and unable to perform killing, yet it is a demon who wishes everyone to be evil. It uses the greed in people and lures them to the gamble to perform this cruel soul-gambling game after game. Ghost Xi’E uses its unique power to build dreams, turning the gambling game into a small illusion, luring the participants in it. For those who are inside this illusion, this gambling game is nothing but a real killing game. They will be hunted by devils during the escape, and Ghost Xi’E would conjure many cardholders to allow people to expel those devils who are also the poor souls that are imprisoned by Ghost Xi’E. Cheated by Ghost Xi’E, gamblers join the game one by one, which keeps the game alive. However, no one will actually win except for the Ghost. An Unfair Competition Without exceptions, all the gamblers put their souls at stake. They are dragged into the illusion in groups of four. What they are facing is only one devil, who seems to be outnumbered, yet the gamblers are relatively weaker under the threats of the devil. All they can do is to collect cards, break the seal and expel the devil. However the items that they redeemed from Ghost Xi’E only add small chances to survival. Ghost Xi’E’s tricks also haunt the devil so that it can never directly catch the preys in order to rouse the killing thirst inside them. The devil must wisely use its powerful pursuing ability to catch and execute the gamblers, or else become dust. Gamblers with Different Desires Every gambler who comes to this game is a living soul. They all come here with different purposes, some has lost their loved ones and money and wants to regain youth, beauty and their lives; some runs away from crimes and wants to make the final struggle here; some are innocent and naive, only to be tricked to come here; some come here for brothers, willing to sacrifice for others. However, no matter who they are and what their purposes are, in the eyes of Ghost Xi’E, they are nothing but souls and something to play with. The Cruel and Wronged Devils Ghost Xi’E gathered countless wronged spirits and transformed them into cruel devils. With the power of resentment, each devil possesses a unique and despairing power. Charming Oriental Scenes Ghost Xi’E builds illusions one by one based on reality world so that they are too real for one to see the truth. A plagued abandoned train station where heavy bangs and cracking can be heard in the wind. A hundred years old palace that used to be so flourishing is now deserted, terrible sighing can be heard during the midnight. A far away Hakka Tulou that was cursed due to a terrible ghost wedding has lost its peace. In these half real and half unreal scenes, gamblers have gradually forgotten the real world. The Stake-redeemed Items In every gamble, the gamblers can obtain stakes via sealing the cardholders while the devil via catching and killing gamblers. This senseless stakes gave both parties the hopes to win and rouse their greed. The stakes can be redeemed for all kinds of surviving and hunting items from Ghost Xi’E. Beneath these hopes are nothing but the tricks of the demon who only wants to feed on people’s essence and energy. The Game of Souls In countless gambles, the gamblers and the devils continually explore and learn from each other. As a gambler, one must decide whether to focus on the cardholders or helping the injured teammates, or escape by items or depending only on themselves. As a devil, one must decide whether to hunting or waiting for gamblers to come to you, whether to chase or sneaking attack. Each encounter is a game, and every choice might endanger your soul. It is a game of souls after all, and the stake is your life. The Inflated Desires In order to entangle all the participants, Ghost Xi’E uses many ways to assist the growth of gamblers and devils. In order to win more gambles, the gamblers and the devils must constantly enhance themselves to discover more abilities so that they might live a little bit longer to meet another unknown gamble. This is for filling the bottomless greed, also simply for surviving.

Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 “Huey”: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 “Loach”: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G “Cobra”: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian “Bushranger”: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 “grease gun”, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forces’ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their “home field advantage”, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can’t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right “Ho Chi Minh Trail” ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team’s spawning rate, when times get desperate “Ambush Spawn” ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps                                                Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i3 @ 2.5GHz or AMD Phenom @ 2.5GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or ATI Radeon HD 5850,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space,Additional Notes:,UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE: 32-bit Operating Systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i5 @ 3.2GHz or AMD @ 4.0GHz or better,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X or better,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 $24.99          $216.31           1\n",
